# React Quiz App

This is a simple React app designed to function as a quiz. The primary goal of this project was to learn fundamental React concepts and put this knowledge to use by building a fully functional application. I sourced the initial data from [questions.json](https://gist.github.com/cmota/f7919cd962a061126effb2d7118bec72) and created a Python script to preprocess it with shuffle algorithm for the app's requirements. The app is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices. I built this independently, referring only to available documentation and MDN. No step by step tutorials.
